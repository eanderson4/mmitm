North and South Diamond are popular back country ski area's west of Fort Collins.  Storms will roll over the Park Range Rabbit Ears pass area.  They then gain strength over the flat Walden/Park area directly east.

When the Storm hits the Never Summer Mountain range the winds blow the snow into the Valley east.  This creates some amazing powder and skiing but is also prone to Wind slabs at the top.

The Hamburger Trees are on the east side of HW 14 and are a good safe low angle bet during more dangerous days.
