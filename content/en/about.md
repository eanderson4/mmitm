# Meet Me in the Mountains (MMitM)

Meet Me in the Mountains aims to be a spot to discuss the mountains.  It will start focused on lost resorts and backcountry and perhaps expand from there.

## Lost Resorts

<a href="http://coloradoskihistory.com">Colorado Ski History</a> provides an excellent recent on historical ski sites.  We want to make this information easily accessible and to be able to access it through a mapping interface.

## Social Aspect

MMitM wants to connect like minding people.  We provide simple comment section to make notes on any post.
