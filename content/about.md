# Meet Me in the Mountains (MMitM)

First a huge THANKS to <a href="[http://coloradoskihistory.com](http://coloradoskihistory.com "http://coloradoskihistory.com")">Colorado Ski History</a> and <a href="[https://www.snowsportsmuseum.org/exhibits](https://www.snowsportsmuseum.org/exhibits "https://www.snowsportsmuseum.org/exhibits")"> Meet Me in the Mountains is a public resource that encourages user interaction by providing their knowledge.  Without the above help, we could never have made this site.  The goal is to create a dynamic knowledge base of all the lost ski areas.  This knowledge base can then be used by back country enthusiasts, explorers, and historians alike.

## Lost Resorts

MMitM wants to do more though.  We provides a Wiki style sites that strives to constantly learn more about lost ski areas.  Even if users don't have anything to contribute from a history standpoint, we hope to create a local form so those who have been to the area can report on (snowpack, weather, pictures, etc)

## Social Aspect

MMitM wants to connect Back country skiers, historians, explores and generally curious people.  We provide a simple comment section so you can provide your stories and feedback about listed locations
