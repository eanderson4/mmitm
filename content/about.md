# Meet Me in the Mountains (MMitM)

First a huge THANKS to <a href="[http://coloradoskihistory.com](http://coloradoskihistory.com "http://coloradoskihistory.com")">Colorado Ski History</a> and <a href="[https://www.snowsportsmuseum.org/exhibits](https://www.snowsportsmuseum.org/exhibits "https://www.snowsportsmuseum.org/exhibits")">The Snow Sports Museum</a> Without the above resources, this website would be no where near as complete as it currently is without them.  

MMitM is not just a ski history website.  At its core it is a website dedicated to preserving the rich ski history of the state.  In doing so, we also provide a resource for back country skiing, hiking, exploring, and all types of adventures.

## Lost Resorts

We provides a Wiki style sites that strives to constantly learn more about lost ski areas.  Even if users don't have anything to contribute from a history standpoint, we hope to create a local form so those who have been to the area can report on (snow-pack, weather, pictures, etc)

## Social Aspect

MMitM wants to connect you; the back country skiers, historians, explores and generally curious people.  We provide information and location and you provide your stories, weather, and photos in the comment section!
