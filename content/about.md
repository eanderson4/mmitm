# Meet Me in the Mountains (MMitM)

First a huge THANKS to <a href="[http://coloradoskihistory.com](http://coloradoskihistory.com "http://coloradoskihistory.com")">Colorado Ski History</a> and <a href="[https://www.snowsportsmuseum.org/exhibits](https://www.snowsportsmuseum.org/exhibits "https://www.snowsportsmuseum.org/exhibits")">The Snow Sports Museum</a> Meet Me in the Mountains is a public resource that encourages user interaction by providing their knowledge.  Without the above resources, this website would be no where near as complete as it currently is.  

MMitM a dynamic knowledge base of all the lost ski areas.  The ultamate goal being a knowledge base that can be leveraged by back country enthusiasts, explorers, photographers, weather junkies, and historians alike.

## Lost Resorts

MMitM wants to do more though.  We provides a Wiki style sites that strives to constantly learn more about lost ski areas.  Even if users don't have anything to contribute from a history standpoint, we hope to create a local form so those who have been to the area can report on (snow-pack, weather, pictures, etc)

## Social Aspect

MMitM wants to connect Back country skiers, historians, explores and generally curious people.  We provide a simple comment section so you can provide your stories and feedback about listed locations
